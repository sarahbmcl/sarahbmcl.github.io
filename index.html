                Following this public service path, I gained my full clinical licensure and have been practicing therapy at a hospital for children.
                While this work is both rewarding and challenging, I  transitioning from the healthcare field into the tech field to pursure more creative endeavors in Web Development.

                My goal is to expand my current skill set to create a lifelong career path in the tech industry serving clients and my organization.
